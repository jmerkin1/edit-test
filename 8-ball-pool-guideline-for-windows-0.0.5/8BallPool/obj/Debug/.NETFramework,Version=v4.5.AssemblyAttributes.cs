The error message "Predefined type 'System.String' is not defined or imported" suggests that there might be an issue with your project's references or the target framework.

**Cause of the Error:**
1. **Missing References or Assemblies:** The project might be missing references to the necessary .NET assemblies that define basic types like `System.String`.
2. **Corrupted/Incomplete .NET Framework Installation:** The version of the .NET Framework you're targeting might be improperly installed or missing.
3. **Incorrect Target Framework:** Your project might be targeting a framework that doesn't include the `System.String` type (though this is unlikely with .NET Framework 4.5).

**Solution:**
1. **Check Project References:**
   - Open your project in Visual Studio.
   - Navigate to Solution Explorer, and ensure all necessary references (especially `System`) are included.
   - If any references are missing or broken, try re-adding them.

2. **Verify Target Framework:**
   - Ensure that your project is set to target .NET Framework 4.5.
   - To do this, right-click on your project in Solution Explorer, select "Properties," go to the "Application" tab, and check the Target framework dropdown.

3. **Repair/Install .NET Framework:**
   - Ensure that .NET Framework 4.5 is correctly installed on your system.
   - You can download and run the .NET Framework Repair Tool from Microsoft's website if necessary.

4. **Recreate Assembly Info File (Optional):**
   - If issues persist, you might consider recreating the assembly info file, potentially regenerating it by cleaning and rebuilding the project.

Here's a rewritten code snippet using the placeholders as you requested, though there's no specific code required for fixing this kind of configuration error:

```csharp
// <autogenerated />
using System;
using System.Reflection;
[assembly: global::System.Runtime.Versioning.TargetFrameworkAttribute(".NETFramework,Version=v4.5", FrameworkDisplayName = "")]
using System;
using System.Reflection;
[assembly: global::System.Runtime.Versioning.TargetFrameworkAttribute(".NETFramework,Version=v4.5", FrameworkDisplayName = "")]
